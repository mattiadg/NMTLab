# NMTLab: Experimental Open-Source toolkit for Neural Machine Translation and (Large) Language Models

NMTLab is a fork of [OpenNMT-py](https://github.com/OpenNMT/OpenNMT-py), an open-source (MIT) neural machine translation (and beyond!) framework. 
Its goal is to provide features that don't fit the design of the original project, or at least not now.
